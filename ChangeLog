		ChangeLog file for zlib

Changes in 0.95 (16 Aug 95)
- fix MSDOS small and medium model (now easier to adapt to any compiler)
- inlined send_bits
- fix the final (:-) bug for deflate with flush (output was correct but
  not completely flushed in rare occasions).
- default window size is same for compression and decompression
  (it's now sufficient to set MAX_WBITS in zconf.h).
- voidp -> voidpf and voidnp -> voidp (for consistency with other
  typedefs and because voidnp was not near in large model).

Changes in 0.94 (13 Aug 95)
- support MSDOS medium model
- fix deflate with flush (could sometimes generate bad output)
- fix deflateReset (zlib header was incorrectly suppressed)
- added support for VMS
- allow a compression level in gzopen()
- gzflush now calls fflush
- For deflate with flush, flush even if no more input is provided.
- rename libgz.a as libz.a
- avoid complex expression in infcodes.c triggering Turbo C bug
- work around a problem with gcc on Alpha (in INSERT_STRING)
- don't use inline functions (problem with some gcc versions)
- allow renaming of Byte, uInt, etc... with #define.
- avoid warning about (unused) pointer before start of array in deflate.c
- avoid various warnings in gzio.c, example.c, infblock.c, adler32.c, zutil.c
- avoid reserved word 'new' in trees.c

Changes in 0.93 (25 June 95)
- temporarily disable inline functions
- make deflate deterministic
- give enough lookahead for PARTIAL_FLUSH
- Set binary mode for stdin/stdout in minigzip.c for OS/2
- don't even use signed char in inflate (not portable enough)
- fix inflate memory leak for segmented architectures

Changes in 0.92 (3 May 95)
- don't assume that char is signed (problem on SGI)
- Clear bit buffer when starting a stored block
- no memcpy on Pyramid
- suppressed inftest.c
- optimized fill_window, put longest_match inline for gcc
- optimized inflate on stored blocks.
- untabify all sources to simplify patches

Changes in 0.91 (2 May 95)
- Default MEM_LEVEL is 8 (not 9 for Unix) as documented in zlib.h
- Document the memory requirements in zconf.h
- added "make install"
- fix sync search logic in inflateSync
- deflate(Z_FULL_FLUSH) now works even if output buffer too short
- after inflateSync, don't scare people with just "lo world"
- added support for DJGPP

Changes in 0.9 (1 May 95)
- don't assume that zalloc clears the allocated memory (the TurboC bug
  was Mark's bug after all :)
- let again gzread copy uncompressed data unchanged (was working in 0.71)
- deflate(Z_FULL_FLUSH), inflateReset and inflateSync are now fully implemented
- added a test of inflateSync in example.c
- moved MAX_WBITS to zconf.h because users might want to change that.
- document explicitly that zalloc(64K) on MSDOS must return a normalized
  pointer (zero offset)
- added Makefiles for Microsoft C, Turbo C, Borland C++
- faster crc32()

Changes in 0.8 (29 April 95)
- added fast inflate (inffast.c)
- deflate(Z_FINISH) now returns Z_STREAM_END when done. Warning: this
  is incompatible with previous versions of zlib which returned Z_OK.
- work around a TurboC compiler bug (bad code for b << 0, see infutil.h)
  (actually that was not a compiler bug, see 0.81 above)
- gzread no longer reads one extra byte in certain cases
- In gzio destroy(), don't reference a freed structure
- avoid many warnings for MSDOS
- avoid the ERROR symbol which is used by MS Windows

Changes in 0.71 (14 April 95)
- Fixed more MSDOS compilation problems :( There is still a bug with
  TurboC large model.

Changes in 0.7 (14 April 95)
- Added full inflate support.
- Simplified the crc32() interface. The pre- and post-conditioning
  (one's complement) is now done inside crc32(). WARNING: this is
  incompatible with previous versions; see zlib.h for the new usage.

Changes in 0.61 (12 April 95)
- workaround for a bug in TurboC. example and minigzip now work on MSDOS.

Changes in 0.6 (11 April 95)
- added minigzip.c
- added gzdopen to reopen a file descriptor as gzFile
- added transparent reading of non-gziped files in gzread.
- fixed bug in gzread (don't read crc as data)
- fixed bug in destroy (gzio.c) (don't return Z_STREAM_END for gzclose).
- don't allocate big arrays in the stack (for MSDOS)
- fix some MSDOS compilation problems

Changes in 0.5:
- do real compression in deflate.c. Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH is supported but
  not yet Z_FULL_FLUSH.
- support decompression but only in a single step (forced Z_FINISH)
- added opaque object for zalloc and zfree.
- added deflateReset and inflateReset
- added a variable zlib_version for consistency checking.
- renamed the 'filter' parameter of deflateInit2 as 'strategy'.
  Added Z_FILTERED and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY constants.

Changes in 0.4:
- avoid "zip" everywhere, use zlib instead of ziplib.
- suppress Z_BLOCK_FLUSH, interpret Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH as block flush
  if compression method == 8.
- added adler32 and crc32
- renamed deflateOptions as deflateInit2, call one or the other but not both
- added the method parameter for deflateInit2.
- added inflateInit2
- simplied considerably deflateInit and inflateInit by not supporting
  user-provided history buffer. This is supported only in deflateInit2
  and inflateInit2.

Changes in 0.3:
- prefix all macro names with Z_
- use Z_FINISH instead of deflateEnd to finish compression.
- added Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY
- added gzerror()
