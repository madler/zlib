Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose, including
commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it freely, subject to
the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:

    Redistributions of source code (in whole or in part) must retain the above
    copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list of conditions.

    Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries) must
    reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list
    of conditions in documentation and/or other materials provided with the
    distribution. Additional documentation is not needed for executables where a
    command line license option provides these and a note regarding this option
    is in the executable's startup banner. The sole exception to this condition
    is redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as part
    of a self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion of this
    license, as long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed from the
    binary or disabled.

    Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating
    systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with
    modified or added functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library
    versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not be
    misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries, compiled from
    the original source. Such altered versions also must not be misrepresented
    as being Info-ZIP releases--including, but not limited to, labeling of the
    altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP" (or any variation thereof,
    including, but not limited to, different capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip,"
    "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the explicit permission of Info-ZIP. Such altered
    versions are further prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs
    or Info-ZIP e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-
    ZIP will provide support for the altered versions.

    Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
    "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its own
    source and binary releases.
