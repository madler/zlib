zlib 0.95 is a beta version of a general purpose compression library.
This should be the last version before the first official
version (1.0), so please test it now. (At least compile and run it with
"make test"). This version has no known bugs.

The data format used by the zlib library is described in the
files zlib-3.1.doc, deflate-1.1.doc and gzip-4.1.doc, available
in ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/doc.

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file
zlib.h. A usage example of the library is given in the file example.c
which also tests that the library is working correctly. Another
example is given in the file minigzip.c.

To compile all files and run the test program, just type: make test
(For MSDOS, use one of the special makefiles such as Makefile.msc;
for VMS, use Make_vms.com or descrip.mms.)
To install the zlib library (libz.a) in /usr/local/lib, type: make install
To install in a different directory, use for example:
  make install prefix=$HOME
This will install in $HOME/lib instead of /usr/local/lib.

The changes made in version 0.95 are documented in the file ChangeLog.
The main changes since 0.94 are:
- fix MSDOS small and medium model (now easier to adapt to any compiler)
- inlined send_bits
- fix the final (:-) bug for deflate with flush (output was correct but
  not completely flushed in rare occasions).

For MSDOS, the small and medium models have been tested only with Microsoft C.
(This should now work for Borland C also, but I don't have a recent Borland
compiler to test with.) The small model was tested with Turbo C but only with
reduced performance to avoid any far allocation; it was tested with
 -DMAX_WBITS=11 -DMAX_MEM_LEVEL=3
